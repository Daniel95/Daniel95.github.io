                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, students from all kinds of studies were selected to <br>participate in this excelention project.<br> 
                    We would work on this project all week long, from 10 till 5 and we would<br> also no longer participate in normal class for 4 weeks.<br><br>
                    
                    The goal of this project was to make an eyecatcher for visitors of<br> MediaBytes 2016 in Mediacafe in Vondelpark Amsterdam.<br> 
                    The end result was a big projection in the middle of the central hall where we<br> visualized the connections made in the Connectif app.<br>
                    This app was made to connect students and professionals with eachother by swiping<br> eachother left or right, kind of like tinder.<br>
                </p>
