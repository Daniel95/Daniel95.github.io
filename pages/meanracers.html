                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Meanracers is a project that really learned me alot. I had previously thought of the idea of a multiplayer platformer game, <br>and when our school game us the assignment make our own vacancy for a game that other students could apply on,<br> this was the perfect opportunity to try and make that game.<br> We had one student who knew alot about Javascript,<br> so we decided in order to learn more about it we are going to make this game in Javascript.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The goal of the game is to go up as fast as possible by jumping. You automaticly move left or right when you walk against a wall or another player. When one player remains he wins the game and the game restarts.<br> It is fast, simple and exciting to play!
