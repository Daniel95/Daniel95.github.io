                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Meanracers is a project that really learned me alot. I had previously thought of the idea of a multiplayer platformer game, <br>and when our school game us the assignment make our own vacancy for a game that other students could apply on,<br> this was the perfect opportunity to try and make that game.<br> We had one student who knew alot about Javascript,<br> so we decided in order to learn more about it we are going to make this game in Javascript.
