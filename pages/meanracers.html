                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Meanracers is a project that really learned me a lot.<br> 
                    I had previously thought of the idea of a multiplayer platformer game,<br> 
                    and when our school gave us the assignment make our own vacancy for a game<br> 
                    that other students could apply on, this was the perfect opportunity to<br> try and make that game.<br><br>
                    We had one student who knew a lot about JavaScript, so we decided that in<br> order to learn more about it we are going to make this game in JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The goal of the game is to go up as fast as possible by jumping.<br> 
                    You automatically  move left or right when you walk against a wall<br> or another player. When one player remains he wins the game and the game restarts.<br> 
                    It is fast, simple and exciting to play!
