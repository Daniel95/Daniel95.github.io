                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    I started this project in the summer vacation. It started with a simple idea of a cube that you steer through a level <br>
                    and if you hit a wall you have try again in another level of the same difficulty. <br>
                    When school began we chose smaller different project that we worked on to complete. <br>
                    I chose the following projects: Perlin Noise Terrain, Destructable Terrain, Water Shader and Terrain Shader. <br>
                    Each time we had one week to complete the project and another week to reflect on what we wanted to do later on. <br>
                    During this time i merged all projects into one and made a it into a game. <br>
                    The result is a cube that you can steer through an endless terrain, with different biomes like land and islands. <br>
                    These are connected to eachother with paths that you can navigate over. <br>
                    There's moving water and land with different colors, made with shaders. <br>
                    The player leaves a trail of destruction behind that devastates the land to you can't retrace your steps.
