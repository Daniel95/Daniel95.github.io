                <td>My name is Daniel Brand, I live in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands. <br>
                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a game development studio which makes 3D<br> 
                    games, preferably in Unity. <br>
                    I want to learn more about online multiplayer, procedural generation <br>
                    and want to continue practicing writing loosy coupled code and working <br> 
                    in teams to create to most awesome games together.<br><br>
                    
                    Endless runner games have been the most fun to make for me since i can decide<br>
                    the games environment and level with code and the content we make can be reused.<br><br>

                    At school I am very proud that every project I completed has been a success,<br>
                    not because we always had the best team, but because we were always organized<br>
                    and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had. <br><br>
                    
                    On school I am learning how to write loosely coupled and well documented code.<br>
                    During projects I also practiced SCRUM, this really helped us manage our groups.<br><br>
                    
                    In my free time I usually work on spare time projects or continue school projects<br> 
                    and play games.<br>
                    Games that I really enjoy are PC games like Darksouls, Civilization V/VI, World of Warcraft,<br> 
                    Battlefield, Brawhalla and Dishonored.<br>
                    I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires and Rise of Nations.<br>
