                <td>My name is Daniel Brand, I live in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands. <br>
                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a game development studio which makes 2D<br> 
                    or 3D endless runner games. <br>
                    I want to learn more about procedural generation, loosy coupled code and<br> 
                    practice teamwork.<br><br>
                    
                    Endless runner games have been the most fun to make for me since i can decide<br>
                    the games environment and level with code and the content I make can be reused.<br><br>

                    At school I am very proud that every project I completed has been a success,<br>
                    not because we always had the best team, but because we were always organized<br>
                    and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had. <br><br>
                    <!--
                    On most projects I worked on in the past I was the lead developer. <br>
                    This didn't mean I decided everything in the group, but I tried to<br> 
                    manage the group and make sure that everyone communicates well does and useful tasks.<br>
                    -->
                    On school I am learning how to write loosely coupled and well documented code.<br>
                    During projects I also practiced SCRUM, this really helped us manage our groups.<br><br>
                    
                    In my free time I usually work on spare time projects or continue school projects<br> 
                    and play games.<br>
                    Games that I really enjoy are PC games like Darksouls, Civilization, World of Warcraft,<br> 
                    Battlefield, Brawhalla.<br>
                    I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires and Rise of Nations.<br>
