        I am looking for an internship at a 2D game studio, I have a lot of experience with 2D games, mostly on mobile.<br> I like to play games like Brawhalla, because of its online competitive nature and DarkMause because it is a 2D game, but still has a lot of depth and content.<br><br>
        Most projects I work on, I am the lead developer, which doesn't mean I decide everything in the group, but that I try to manage the group, and make sure that everyone communicates, works useful tasks and knows how to complete his/her task. <br><br>
        I am very proud that every project I completed at school has been a success, and not because we had the best team every time, but we were always very organized and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had</td>
