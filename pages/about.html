                <td>My name is Daniel Brand, I live in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands. <br>
                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a game development studio which makes 3D<br> 
                    games, preferably in Unity. <br>
                    I want to learn more about online multiplayer, procedural generation <br>
                    and want to continue practicing writing loosy coupled code and working <br> 
                    in teams to create the most awesome games, together.<br>
                    I am used to working with SCRUM.<br><br>
                    
                    Games that I love to make are VR and multiplayer games. <br>
                    In the past my goto types of projects have been endless runners games so<br> 
                    that we could decide the games environment and level with code and the<br>  
                    content we made could be reused.<br><br>

                    At school I am very proud that every project I completed has been a success,<br>
                    not because we always had the best team, but because we were always organized<br>
                    and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had. <br>
                    On these projects I learned a lot about how to work with SCRUM, and we definitely<br> 
                    couldn't have achieved the same result if we didn't use SCRUM.<br><br>
                    
                    In my free time I usually work on spare time projects or continue school projects<br> 
                    and play games.<br>
                    Games that I really enjoy are PC games like Darksouls, Civilization V/VI, <br> 
                    World of Warcraft, Battlefield, Brawhalla and Dishonored.<br>
                    I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires and Rise of Nations.<br>
