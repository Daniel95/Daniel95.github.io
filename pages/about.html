                <td>My name is Daniel Brand, I live in Alphen Aan Den Rijn, the Netherlands. <br>
                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a 2D game studio, I have the most experience with 2D games, mostly on mobile.<br>
                    Most projects I work on, I am the lead developer, which doesn't mean I decide everything in a group, but that I try to manage the group, and make sure that everyone communicates, works useful tasks and knows how to complete his/her task. <br><br>
                    
                    I am very proud that every project I completed at school has been a success, and not because we had the best team every time, but we were always very organized and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had. <br><br>
                    
                In my free time i usually work on spare time projects/or continue school projects and play games.
                Games that i really enjoy are PC games like Darksouls, Civilization, World of Warcraft, Battlefield, Brawhalla. I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires, rise of nations.<br>
