                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a game development studio which makes 3D<br> 
                    games, preferably in Unity. <br>
                    I want to learn more about writing loosy coupled code and working <br> 
                    in teams to create the most awesome games, together.<br>
                    My preferable working method is with SCRUM. <br><br>
                    
                    At school I am very proud that every project I completed has been a success,<br>
                    not because we always had the best team, but because we were always organized<br>
                    and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had. <br>
                    On these projects I learned a lot about how to work with SCRUM, <br>
                    which further amplified our results. <br><br>
                    
                    In my free time I usually work on spare time projects, continue school projects<br> 
                    or play games.<br>
                    I have a broad interest in games that range from Dark Souls to The Witness <br>
                    to Civilization. <br>
                    I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires and Red Alert.<br>
