                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a game development studio which makes 3D
                    games, preferably in Unity.
                    I want to learn more about writing loosy coupled code and working 
                    in teams to create the most awesome games, together.
                    My preferable working method is with SCRUM. <br><br>
                    
                    At school I am very proud that every project I completed has been a success,
                    not because we always had the best team, but because we were always organized
                    and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had.
                    On these projects I learned a lot about how to work with SCRUM,
                    which further amplified our results. <br><br>
                    
                    In my free time I usually work on spare time projects,
                    continue school projects or play games.
                    I have a broad interest in games that range from
                    Dark Souls to The Witness to Civilization. 
                    I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires and Red Alert.
