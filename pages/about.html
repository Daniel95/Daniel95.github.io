                <td>My name is Daniel Brand, I live in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands. <br>
                    I am a junior Game Developer, currently studying at Mediacollege Amsterdam. <br><br>
                    
                    I am looking for an internship at a 2D game studio, I have the most experience<br> with 2D games, mostly on mobile.<br>
                    On most projects I work on I am the lead developer. This doesn't mean I decide<br> everything in a group, but I try to manage the group and make sure that everyone<br> communicates does useful tasks and knows how to complete his/her task. <br><br>
                    
                    I am very proud that every project I completed at school has been a success,<br> not because we had the best team every time, but we were always very organized<br> and knew what we could and could not do in the time we had. <br><br>
                    
                In my free time I usually work on spare time projects or continue school projects<br> and play games.<br>
                Games that I really enjoy are PC games like Darksouls, Civilization, World of Warcraft,<br> Battlefield, Brawhalla. <br>
                I also enjoy to play old RTS games with friends such as Age of Empires and Rise of Nations.<br>
