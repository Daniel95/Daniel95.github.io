                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Winter is coming is our first game that we worked on together with game artists. <br> 
                    It also was the last project of the first year of our study at Mediacollege Amstedam. <br> 
                    The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. To survive  you have to kill<br> enemies with your bow, and dodge their attacks.<br><br>
                    
                    You can aim your bow by holding down the left mouse button to shoot more accurate,<br> or you can spam it to shoot loads of arrows fast but with less accuracy.
